# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates devcontainer definition files for personal development projects focusing on web applications, mobile applications, and desktop applications. The initial phase targets JavaScript/TypeScript web development with comprehensive tooling, while establishing a foundation for future expansion to Python, Tauri (desktop), Flutter (mobile), and Java environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a JavaScript/TypeScript web development devcontainer, so that I can build web applications with a complete development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a JavaScript devcontainer THEN the system SHALL generate devcontainer.json with Node.js LTS image
2. WHEN setting up the environment THEN the system SHALL include npm, yarn, and pnpm package managers
3. WHEN configuring the container THEN the system SHALL add VS Code extensions for JavaScript/TypeScript development
4. WHEN setting up testing tools THEN the system SHALL include Jest and Vitest for unit testing
5. WHEN configuring code quality tools THEN the system SHALL include ESLint and Prettier for linting and formatting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want common development tools pre-configured in all devcontainers, so that I have consistent tooling across different projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating any devcontainer THEN the system SHALL include Git with basic configuration
2. WHEN setting up the environment THEN the system SHALL include curl, wget, and unzip utilities
3. WHEN configuring the shell THEN the system SHALL set up zsh with basic customization
4. WHEN setting up the container THEN the system SHALL include VS Code essential extensions (GitLens, Docker, etc.)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ability to extend devcontainer configurations, so that I can add additional services and tools as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a devcontainer THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation for customization
2. WHEN extending the configuration THEN the system SHALL support adding database services via docker-compose
3. WHEN modifying the setup THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with the base configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a foundation for future development environments, so that I can incrementally add support for Python, Tauri, Flutter, and Java.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the system THEN the system SHALL use a modular structure for easy extension
2. WHEN creating templates THEN the system SHALL establish patterns for language-specific configurations
3. WHEN planning future additions THEN the system SHALL document the roadmap for Python, Tauri, Flutter, and Java support
